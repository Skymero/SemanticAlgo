Context: so very naturally we all find ourselves shouting the same thing moonshot I'm about to go to the Moon unfortunately 36 years on from the ambitious plan set out by the governments around the world far from breaking records by burning plasma at temperatures 10 times hotter than the center of the Sun eer instead is about to break records for budget overruns and schedule delays iter is spread over many countries partners and many independent service companies within those countries it's a confusing monolithic but also dispersed body of activity in theory this is good because it pump primes expertise around the world in various Fusion capabilities but in reality it's an invitation for a really complicated cat H hering exercise over the decades ITA has been plagued by a string of holdups cost overruns and management issues the original completion date for the first plasma operation was 2016 now it's 2034 the involvement of multiple parties with different manufacturing practices standards and quality has led to the magnets the vacuum vessels the cry stats the blanket modules the diverter components the diagnostic systems the cooling apparatus and various electrical components all needing reordering repurchasing and replacing the decisionmaking process within eer itself often requires consensus among all member countries making it incredibly slow and complex and making controlling the direction and capability of ITA about as effective as paddling the Titanic with a pool noodle may I interest you in a pool noodle as a result there have been several changes in the leadership of eer as it search for an effective management style and strategy the fact is there probably isn't one this organizational complexity is an added burden to maybe the most complex project that Humanity has ever undertaken although the EA project formerly began in 2006 with an estimated $6.3 billion price tag it's now somewhere in the region of 22 to 27 billion I couldn't quite get a straight answer on whether this includes the additional 5 billion EUR or not which is now scheduled for its first operation in 2034 our question still is does it make sense to keep pushing forward here or is eer dead I want to put that in context relative to the amount of money that private Fusion companies around the world have raised but before I do that I need to thank today's sponsor for making this episode possible aif flow building the largest Fusion reactor is an incredibly challenging task it's at least twice as hard as running a YouTube channel which is why I use akif flow a productivity app for people who want to be better time managers to make sure I don't go over my budget by several billions of dollars unlike some other applications akif flow uses a calendar system to organize all your tasks events and blocks if I create a new task here with a personalized keyboard shortcut let's say scripting a story I can insert it directly into the calendar just like that when I'm researching one of my favorite features is I can create a task straight from the clipboard meaning I don't need to skip a beat when I'm reading through a document after that it's all contained in a to-do list which you can prioritize and insert into your calendar this way I can combine tasks events and time blocks all into one place that's really the peel of akif flow to me it brings everything together in one place in fact you can also integrate all of these other apps to if you are thinking of starting your own creative projects like a YouTube channel or something a bit more simple like building a fusion reactor check out aif flow in the link Down Below in the description now let's get back to the video let's put some things in context from the numbers that I could find the more than 35 private companies developing Fusion approaches around the world have collectively raised $2.4 billion from private investment and 3.8 billion from public and government funding which brings the total investment in private Fusion to just over 6.2 billion $100 million less than the starting cost of eer at 6.3 billion I've been really lucky to visit some of these teams working on Fusion around the world and one of the things that always strikes me is the diversity of approaches under development from toac approaches like ITA to stellarators inertial confinement approaches whether they're laser based or projectile based there are a lot of viable ways Fusion may be realized in the next 10 years we've definitely learned things from ether or at least maybe learned things not to do

Context: but nothing much yet about the fusion plasma ITA was designed to study in the first place I wonder what the ITA funding directed into a diversified approach would have achieved by now because ultimately we still don't really know which route to Fusion will actually work best this is somewhat analogous to large nuclear fision reactors we can in theory build them but governments around the world often hesitates to actually go through with it for a whole bunch of regulatory safety and other reasons maybe small nuclear reactors or micronuclear reactors like we've covered on this channel before will actually prove out to be the better approach to nuclear fion if we take a Quantum inspired analogy I'd rather Humanity be in a superposition of all possible Fusion approaches advancing towards the end point and then collapse the wave function of find out which one actually works rather than a most of our eggs in one basket approach homie it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket what would you have me do one basket for each egg

Context: but sometimes you just have to fund big science projects think of CERN the LHC or jwst those worked out and ultimately became operational though often times experiened similar te troubles the jwst was intended to be completed in a decade at a cost of around $1 billion in the end it took about 20 years and about $ 10 billion to get the telescope off the ground obviously this is unfortunate for astronomers waiting to stare deeper into our universe and understand more things
