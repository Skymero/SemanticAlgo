One of the most iconic anime ever created. is Akira. Everything starts
with a mysterious explosion in Tokyo, and it leads to this era of aggressive
rebuilding And the birth of an artificial megacity
in the middle of Tokyo bay, Neo Tokyo,
which would be right about there. It's a story about a lost generation
and about human experimentation and civic chaos,
and it's about the struggle for identity in a technologically
and politically turbulent society. But it's not just the story, but this fantastical cityscape
that's both synthetic and organic. Both grant yet intimate, sinister yet nostalgic that has etched Akira
into our collective memory. I want to talk about the origin of Neo
Tokyo and the story of three different people,
separated by time and space, whose visions somehow led to the creation
of this incredible world. a portion of this video sponsored by LG the creator of Akira, Katsuhiro
Otomo, was born in Tohoku, which is a remote scenic region
in the northeast of Japan. But in the 70s,
after high school, he moved to Tokyo. He said it was like being in a different era
For the first time, he saw things like student demonstrations
and gangs and homelessness. And he was particularly fascinated
by one subculture the Bōsōzoku youth biker
gangs, known for being loud and wild and driving
recklessly on their custom bikes, which is kind of surprising coming from
one of the politest cultures in the world. But it's actually a symptom of a society
that evolved too fast. It goes like this. After WW2 Japan exprienced urbanization
and industrialization at insane speed. Especially in places like Tokyo and Osaka. This led to what is known
as the “Japanese Economic Miracle” and it made Japan one of the fastest
growing economy in the world. There was a growing middle class, but there was also
lots of people who felt left behind. And Bōsōzoku gave these people,
especially the youth, a sense of identity and community with their own rituals
and rules and even uniforms. The streetscapes transformed as well. Commercial clusters called Yokocho
started to pop up around train stations, where you can find the tiniest micro bars
and restaurants, or the vertical versions of these,
the Zakkyo, with signage all over the facade
to lure people in from the street. As more of these fill the city. It also placed
Tokyo in the collective imagination. And all of this is what Otomo tried
to capture in Akira.  This is where Neo Tokyo would have been. Of course,
it doesn't actually exist in real life, but the almost build
something very similar. There were two main industrial zones
that were instrumental to this postwar economic boom, and people flocked
to these areas from all over Japan. But the population growth wasn't
really properly planned or controlled, so it was seriously overcrowded
and there was a serious lack of infrastructure or essential services. Several proposals tried to tackle
this problem, including plans for filling up
almost 70% of Tokyo Bay with the land. But this proposal got the most attention. It was a concept for a floating island
with these mega spines that spanned across Tokyo Bay,
with adaptable residential modules that could be added or sunk,
and have followed the principles of a new architectural
movement called metabolism. This is the very first and one of the very few built examples
of the metabolism movement, a movement that believe that buildings and cities
are like living organisms, and it should adapt and grow
based on the needs of the population. But the movement never really took off at
the building scale or at the city scale. they never ended up
adopting any of these proposals. Instead, they opted to intensify land use
within existing urban areas. They developed
new satellite cities and towns, and they expanded into Tokyo Bay. And they also improve transportation
to better connect these areas, eventually turning it into one of the most efficient
and beautiful transportation networks in the world. But Otomo decided to adopt the idea
of this artificial island for Neo Tokyo, and in Akira, it creates this physical
and symbolic division between the old and the new. and this radical concept
was by an architect called Kenzo Tange Kenzo Tange is arguably one of
the most influential Japanese architects. He received the Pritzker Prize in 1987,
which is like the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in architecture. Tange was born in Osaka in 1913. Then he moved to Hiroshima
in high school in 1930, where he came across this drawing,
a drawing by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, Who is considered to be
the father of modernism. Modernism was a rejection of the past
and all of these historical styles that came before it that they considered
to be stuffy and inauthentic. It was this vision
for a new democratic architecture that reflected the spirit
of the industrial age. By removing ornamentation
and focusing on the function over form. Although this is
how most architecture trained now, back then this was pretty radical,
Especially in Japan, that pretty much had an unbroken tradition of architecture
which developed, isolated from the Western world
over thousands of years. Anyway, it was this that made Kenzo Tange
want to become an architect Later in his life. Tuncay would work at the office of Mikawa,
who actually worked for Corbusier and designed buildings
that almost remind me of this perfect Midjourney blend of modernism
and traditional Japanese architecture. So Tange learned from him,
but he was even more radical since he was propelled by this postwar
energy of needing to build quickly and efficiently, while also having
this desire to start fresh. he shocked everyone by designing buildings
like this. And this and this. During a time
when buildings looked like this. For his Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, which is
one of the major landmarks of Tokyo, apparently he took inspiration from Gothic cathedrals,
but also from computer chips. And for the unfinished Olympic Stadium
in Akira That's where everything ends. The Yoyogi National Gymnasium served
as the inspiration, in this case, not so much for the design,
but for the symbolism. The Yoyogi Gymnasium was built in 1964 for the Tokyo Olympics,
which was a huge deal at the time. It was a very first Asian country
to host the Olympics, and it was just 19 years after the war. And so the Olympics really helped propel
Japan into this period of high growth. In Akira,
the bomb hits Tokyo in 1988, and roughly 31 years later in 2019,
they're selected to host the Olympics. But it actually happened in real life. Remember before Covid. Tokyo was supposed to host the 2020
Olympics. anyways, in both the real building
and the manga, the stadium symbolizes Japan's revival
and entry onto the world stage. The stadium was also a first of its kind, because Tange didn't want any columns
between the athletes and the spectators. He created a suspended roof and suspending
a roof over such a large distance. Although it had been done for bridges
before, it's never been been done for buildings. it was inspired by the Philips Pavilion
by  Le Corbusier except it was about ten times in size, and it evokes certain
traditional Japanese qualities. And it kind of reminds you
of a Japanese pagoda. And standing here. This thing is impressive. With these sweeping curves. And I can imagine
how it could have inspired Otomo Especially for that time. The difference is that in New Tokyo
it was full of colors, colors that were incredibly vibrant,
especially when you put on my LG  My View monitor,
who's also the sponsor of today's video. I was looking for a monitor
that's big enough for what I'm doing. Research. And also something we can use to review
videos as a team. This 31.5in
panel means I can have a double or triple or even quadruple views on it,
and the 4K IPS display is super crisp with a wide color gamut,
So it's become really useful for when we're editing assets
that require color accuracy. as lots of different options
for connection. Including a 90 watt usb-C port
that can charge your laptop. It even comes with a full HD detachable webcam
with a microphone and a privacy shutter. But this is not only a TV sized monitor,
it's also a full feature. Smart TV. you can use LG webOS to run apps
or cast content from any of your devices, and even watch Netflix
without the need to connect to a computer. It's got its own speakers,
and honestly, it's a great option. If you live in a small apartment
and you need a standalone device that can function as a second screen
and a smart TV. If you want to learn more about my view,
check out the link in the description. The production of Akira used 327 distinct colors, which is far more than the typical 100
to 150 use for that time, And 50 of these colors were created
specifically for the film. Since everything was hand-drawn back
then, the decision to use such a wide palette of colors was a huge investment
in time and resources And in Akira, these colors are used strategically to symbolize
different themes and emotions. For example,
red is used to create a heightened sense of urgency and intensity,
and also danger and violence. Green seems to represent elements or
scenes that are unnatural or artificial, or the kind of scenes with mysterious elements of technology
or supernatural powers. In this case, it's
combined with a bold red, and it feels somehow sinister. One of the critiques of modernism
is that it feels sterile and lifeless, but here the city feels alive and dynamic. Especially with elements like this. With this maze of cables and wires
that mimic blood vessels and nerves, it almost blurs
this line between organic and mechanical. And the city reminds you of a kind of
organism that has a life of its own. Kenzo. Kenzo Tange's work might have influenced
the architecture of Neo Tokyo, but the massive scale of the city
was inspired by Metropolis, Which is one of the most iconic films
from the 1920s by the Austrian filmmaker Fritz Lang,
Lang was born in 1890, in Vienna, and he was initially interested
in studying architecture. But when he moved to Berlin
after World War One, which was a hotspot for artistic experimentation,
he fell in love with film. Then in 1924, Fritz Lang
visited... New York City. New York exploded in the 1920s
thanks to innovations in steel and reinforced concrete,
which allowed them to build much taller. This led to a population boom,
and because Manhattan is an island, it grew even taller. He saw the skyscrapers and the factories
and the energy. And he tried to capture all of this,
but at a mega scale. Using set design and special effects
that were insane for that time. He created the image of a mega city
which actually inspired movies like Blade Runner and Star Wars,
And of course, Akira and Neo Tokyo. With massive towers and sky bridges
connecting different towers, and this constant backdrop of searchlights,
which symbolize surveillance and control. But when you look at this detail
right here, it actually tells the story
of two very different cities. So Metropolis is a mega city with a very clear
vertical separation, with the upper class at the top
and the working class at the bottom operating this machine
that keeps everyone afloat. So even though it's very tall, it's
not really a multi-layered city. In Neo Tokyo,
the skyways on rooftops are public spaces. Meaning there's some sort of public path
that bring people to the top. But in reality, this is not so common
in most cities because skyways and the buildings leading to
these rooftops are privately owned. The access is restricted
especially to the undesirable groups like the Bōsōzoku
the people like the business owner. We actually spent a month in Tokyo
while making this video. So I did get to see a lot of different
rooftop parks. This one was my favorite...  It's on top of a shopping mall
and it's very porous. And by that, I mean there's lots of
different access points from the street. There's outdoor and indoor components. the main public stairwell,
it actually slices through the mall, And it stays open
even after the mall's closed. And I've never seen anything
like this here in Vancouver, so I thought this was
a really successful example. But apparently it's pretty controversial
with the locals because this plot of land used to be a real public park
before they built the shopping mall. But for me, this complex layering and this push
and pull of different entities, all within this intense density. And so how everything works. You can kind of get lost
and you can get pulled into a million different directions. And there's layers to this city
that you will never fully understand. And for me,
this is what makes a city so interesting. A city is a thing that you cannot confine. An object
that extends its shadow beyond its limits. Each one of these people we talked about today were transformed by cities. Cities shocked them and inspired them. And fueled their imaginations. And they ended up creating their own
twisted and fantastical versions of these cities. and I think it's
because some cities have a soul. Formed by this serendipitous
mix of millions of people who bring their own dreams
and ambitions and fears. And when they collide, someway, somehow, it can create something extraordinary. There's a lot of research that we did
that didn't make it into this video. So if you guys are interested, as always,
we'll have that in our research booklet. We also consulted these books,
which are both really great. We also generated tons of custom graphics for this video
and we decided to put them into T-shirts. if you guys are interested,
everything is in the description. So what do you guys think? Have you ever felt like a city had a soul? Let me know in the comments! I love. central part is the it is truly a multi-layered city. central part is the See how this central part
is the publicly accessible area? And then those are the commercial areas. one of the things that I noticed the most
when I came to Tokyo is that every time I go, it's like there's layers after layers after layers, So we are trying to get to a park right
there. It's called a miyoshi to park. and it's all accessible. The intent
was that these prefabricated capsules could plug in and out,
depending on the needs of the residents.
